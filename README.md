# Stromzeiten App

Everything you need to know about the project

## What is Stromzeiten app

Stromzeiten is an app designed to provide near real-time data on carbon intensity from electricity production across Europe. By monitoring and displaying carbon intensity levels, Stromzeiten guides you on the optimal times to use electricity, helping you make smarter energy decisions at home. By scheduling energy-intensive activities during periods of lower carbon intensity, you can reduce your environmental impact.

## What is Carbon Intensity

Carbon intensity is measured in grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted per kilowatt-hour (gCO2/kWh) of electricity produced. This unit tells us how many grams of CO2 are released into the atmosphere for every kilowatt-hour of electricity we use. A lower number means cleaner electricity with fewer emissions, while a higher number indicates dirtier electricity with more emissions. By understanding and monitoring this unit, we can make more environmentally friendly choices about when to use electricity.

## Power consumption planning

The Stromzeiten app provides you with a live forecast of carbon intensity, indicating the times when electricity in your home will be the cleanest over the next 48 hours. This helps you plan your energy usage more efficiently.The carbon intensity forecast provided by Stromzeiten is based on weather predictions and can change due to sudden or unexpected weather conditions. Please be aware that real-time conditions might affect the forecast.

## Inspiration

The app was inspired by platforms like Electricity Maps and the National Grid ESO Carbon Intensity Dashboard. These sites do an awesome job showing carbon intensity data. But with Stromzeiten, the goal is to take it a step further by giving you a simple way to know the best times to plug in and use electricity across European countries.

## Data Source 

The app relies on real-time data provided by the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform API. This platform aggregates and shares detailed information about electricity production and consumption across Europe. By tapping into this reliable and comprehensive data source, Stromzeiten ensures that you receive accurate and up-to-date carbon intensity values and energy source breakdowns for your country. This allows you to make informed decisions about your energy usage and contribute to a more sustainable future.
